    description: `
      <p>‘Pozos del Cielo’ is a light installation that reflects on space travel and the growing aerospace race in which we find ourselves immersed. It is inspired by the sculptures of the same name by Jean Nouvel, located in the central park of Poble Nou, Barcelona. The piece revisits the architect’s original idea: a window to the sky that allows light to pass through a dense layer of vegetation, designed to gradually cover the park over time. Back then, Nouvel aimed to address concerns about urban pollution, offering a space for contemplation and a connection to the sky in the middle of the city. Now, years later, we ask ourselves what else this well might reveal and what other things, besides light, could filter through it.</p>
      <p>If we look up at the sky in complete darkness, we find the moon, the stars, and celestial bodies that evoke peace and purity. But alongside them, satellites, fragments of space debris, and spacecraft also orbit. The occupation of outer space has grown exponentially, and the number of satellites in orbit continues to rise. This installation reinterprets Nouvel’s work in light of this transformation, establishing a dialogue between his original vision and today’s technological reality.</p>
      <p>This project was created for the Llum 2025 festival in Barcelona, an annual event held in the Poble Nou neighborhood that attracts thousands of visitors. Representing BAU, Centre Universitari d’Arts i Disseny, we developed the piece with a team of eight people through a multidisciplinary approach combining design, digital fabrication, electrical systems, and programming.</p>
      <p>For its development, we built our own LED light bars, synchronized via the Art-Net protocol to follow a specific lighting choreography. As a site-specific installation for an outdoor location, the project presented technical challenges related to power supply and communication between the different devices. We designed an efficient system to ensure the installation’s operational stability, guaranteeing its proper function in a changing environment exposed to weather conditions.</p>
      <p>My role within the team was production direction, overseeing digital fabrication and making strategic decisions throughout the process. I was also responsible for designing the electrical and lighting system, ensuring its implementation and correct operation, while contributing continuously to the research, conceptualization, and programming of the piece.</p>,
      <p>The result was a visually striking, immersive, and publicly accessible work that successfully materialized a lighting choreography based on patterns observed during our research. It serves as an update to Nouvel’s work, addressing the concerns of our time—projecting not just light onto the park, but also questions about the present and future of our sky.</p>

    description: `
      <p>An interactive artistic piece (one of three in total) developed in collaboration with ceramic artist Lili Díaz and singer Camila Terán, as part of the exhibition “Puede ser en el Bosque”, an immersive experience in nature where various artistic disciplines intertwined with the landscape. Inspired by the legend of “La Loba”, which tells the story of a wolf skeleton transforming into a woman through chants of an old woman, the piece invites the audience into an act of listening and discovery.</p>
      <p>Suspended in the middle of the forest, the ceramic sculpture held at its center a halo of stars, evoking the symbolism of the sacred. At first sight, the piece projected a sense of stillness, but as visitors approached, they became immersed in a weaving of voices and guttural sounds resonating from within. Howls, laughter, and ancestral chants emerged from the sculpture, but stepping closer to the halo transformed the experience: a proximity sensor triggered a secret message, whispered uniquely and unrepeatably into each visitor’s ear.</p>
      <p>My role in this project was to bring this sonic interaction to life. I designed an analog-digital electronic system that allowed the piece to “speak,” using proximity sensors to respond to the viewer’s presence. To achieve this, I developed a compact and integrated device, employing digital fabrication and materials that blended seamlessly with Lili’s ceramics and the natural surroundings. Additionally, given the outdoor setting, I designed a self-sustaining and portable system that avoided external wiring, preserving the integrity of the installation.</p>
      <p>Another key aspect was the creation and production of the soundscape. Together with Camila, we recorded and edited a combination of human and natural sounds, using sampling, sound design, and programming to construct an immersive sonic universe. Every whisper, every chant, and every sound was carefully crafted to evoke the mythical essence of the story and provoke an intimate reaction in those who ventured to listen.</p>
      <p>The impact of the piece was undeniable. Interaction with the work sparked a genuine emotional response from the audience—astonishment, curiosity, and reflection. Watching visitors approach cautiously, receive a unique message, and walk away deep in thought confirmed that the fusion of art, technology, and storytelling had succeeded. A collaboration that resulted in a living artwork, one that engaged with its surroundings and with those who dared to listen to its secrets.</p>

      <p>The immersive art installation “Simbioc3no: Temporalidades ecoicas y memorias futuras” envisions a future scenario where nature persists without humans, yet the imprint of our existence remains.</p>
      <p>After a sixth mass extinction and under planetary conditions that prevent ecosystems from functioning as we know them today, new systems of intra-species collaboration and communication became necessary to restore natural balance.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with Andrea Galano, Pierantonio Mangia, and Rocío Gomez, we propose a symbiotic system in which nature relies on the technology and waste left behind by humans to sustain its existence.</p>
      <p>Building on the redefinition of the neo-fossil, we explored different geological eras, which helped us imagine a new one—represented through a four-part speculative fable and an audiovisual installation integrating electronic control systems, biofeedback, creative coding, programmed lighting, and generative audio.</p>

      <p>Assamblage(s): A Holobiont Spell is a work by Andrea Galano Toro, developed and presented during the AiR Residency in Prague 2024, for which I contributed by creating the sound design for both the piece and its final installation. This exploration resulted in a musicalized and sound-designed spell, inhabiting the gallery space of Jedna Dva Tri as part of the exhibition Messages at the Crossroads (30.07.2024 - 06.09.2024).</p>
      <p>The spell, structured in four parts—The Gut, The Shelter, The Stranger, and The Debris—explores transformation and the human relationship with the body, the life it hosts, and the ecosystems it forms. Each section, deeply symbolic and distinct, was represented sonically through sample manipulation, spatial recreation, and carefully crafted sound design, with music serving as both a narrative and expressive vehicle.</p>
      <p>Essential to the creation of this work was the symbolic language Andrea created for each section, her vision and connection to them, and, most importantly, her voice—guiding the listener through a journey of transformation and sonic integration.</p>

  about: `
    <p>Ander Vallejo Larre is an Immersive Experience Producer and Creative Technologist with a strong interest in the intersection of science and art, the use of emerging technologies, and the role of artists as transmitters of knowledge. With a background in sound and music production, his work places sound at the core of the experience — a primary channel for engaging audiences emotionally and spatially. His practice explores electronic tools as an extension of nature, generative as well as data-driven systems, and the use of interfaces for improvisation—techniques that have evolved throughout his career.</p>
    <p>As a musician, he has performed at major festivals and venues in Ecuador and Spain. As a music producer, he has participated in festivals such as LAVS Mataró and Planteka Fest, as well as in prominent media outlets like RTVE’s Va de Verd. In Barcelona, he began exploring immersive installations and interactive works, which have been exhibited in various locations, including Barcelona and Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>His involvement in Barcelona’s local scene naturally led him to Dublab.cat, a community radio station, where he hosts a monthly program. His work continues to explore the intersection of sound, electronic systems, and programming through When… Plants… Sing and other collaborative projects.</p>
  `,
  bio:`
    <p>I studied music production to gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects behind music. I then expanded my education by studying jazz piano, drawn to the potential of improvisation and its strong theoretical foundation. Working both in studios and live music settings—on personal projects as well as for clients—and engaging with acoustic, electronic, and digital instruments, I developed fluency and confidence in using these tools across different contexts.</p>
    <p>Over time, my deepening interest in electronic and analog instruments led me to explore electronics and programming. This, combined with my growing focus on interactive narratives around botany and ecology, motivated me to continue my studies in Barcelona, pursuing a degree that would broaden my knowledge in these areas and push me to further develop my work.</p>
